# class object

Class objects are predefined objects in the MWX library, such as `the_twelite`, which handles TWENET, and objects for using peripherals.

Each object must be initialized by calling the `.setup()` or `.begin()` method. (Only Serial objects that use UART0 do not require initialization.)
